To test this setup from Postman, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Set Up Postman for Testing

1. **Open Postman** and create a new request.

2. **Set the Request Method** to `GET`.

3. **Enter the URL** for your endpoint:
   - For secured data: `http://localhost:8080/api/secured/data`
   - For public data: `http://localhost:8080/api/public/data`

### Step 2: Test the Secured Endpoint (`/api/secured/data`)

1. **Add the Authorization Header**:
   - Go to the **Headers** tab.
   - Add a header with the key `X-Auth-Token` and set the value to the expected token value (e.g., `"expected_token_value"`).

2. **Send the Request**:
   - Click **Send** to submit the request.
   - If the token is correct, you should receive a response with the body: `"Here is some secured data!"`

3. **Test Without the Authorization Header**:
   - Remove the `X-Auth-Token` header or set it to an incorrect value.
   - Send the request again.
   - This time, you should receive a `401 Unauthorized` response, with `"Unauthorized"` in the response body.

### Step 3: Test the Public Endpoint (`/api/public/data`)

1. **Set the URL** to `http://localhost:8080/api/public/data`.

2. **Send the Request** without adding any headers.

3. You should receive the response: `"This is public data!"`

### Additional Notes

- **Console Logs**: Check your Spring Boot applicationâ€™s console output after each request to see logs from the interceptor, including any timing or authorization details.
- **Experiment with Different Values**: Try modifying the `X-Auth-Token` header value in Postman to see how the interceptor behaves with valid vs. invalid tokens. 

This setup lets you verify the interceptor functionality and validate both secured and public endpoints.
