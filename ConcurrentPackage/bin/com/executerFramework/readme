The Executors framework simplifies thread management by abstracting thread creation, scheduling, and management.

Key Classes:
1. Executor: A simple interface for executing tasks.

2. ExecutorService: A sub-interface of Executor that provides methods to manage and control thread lifecycle (e.g., shutdown).

3. ScheduledExecutorService: Supports scheduling tasks to run after a delay or periodically.

4. Executors: A utility class for creating preconfigured thread pools.

	4.1. newFixedThreadPool(int nThreads): Creates a pool with a fixed number of threads.
	
	4.2.newCachedThreadPool(): Creates a pool with dynamically growing threads.
	
	4.3.newSingleThreadExecutor(): Creates a single-threaded executor.
	
	4.4.newScheduledThreadPool(int nThreads): Creates a pool that supports scheduled tasks.
